story = "Once upon a time"
#Ruby assigns characters a position in line, which is called the index position
#ruby counts from 0
#example: O is 0 
#bc it counts from 0 the index position will always be one less than the .length

#How to use index positions to extract a specific character from string 
#If I wanted O

puts story[0]
#Use square brackets to get a certain position we want 
#[0] refers to the first character, which is O

#If I want a letter from the end I input a negative number 
puts story [-2]
#this will give me m because it is second to last
